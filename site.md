For the home page, all content was on one page in blocks. 
Links were in html.
This is the same for the about us page. 
We decided not to do a contact us page as all information could be added to the footer. The facebook feed on the home page was implemented through the facebook page plugin, and shortcode was pasted into the page.The events page held events in posts.
